Teams,

=20

Great tournament. May have been the largest gathering of Grand Masters =
Ultimate players to date - with player coming from as far away as Texas =
- and the level of play certainly increased. We had great weather which =
we old guys/girls really appreciate.=20

=20

The final standings were:

1. Ottawa =20

2. Montreal =20

3. Maryland

4. NY/Conn

5. Toronto

6. Montreal/Western Mass Spirit Team

=20

Thanks to all for participating. On behalf of the Ottawa team $500 will =
be donated to a charity of their choice - let me know which one guys. =
For next year we have been trying to get the tournament on an earlier =
date, but so far the tentative date for the tourney next year is Sept. =
27 and 28, 2007.  Mark it in your calendars.

=20

Keep those legs moving and discs flying,

=20

Mike & Mike

Teams,

=20

A couple of minor reminders that have been passed onto me:

=20

1.	No drugs alcohol on the fields, but dogs are allowed=20
2.	For environment reasons, there are no plastic/paper plates supplied =
on the fields at lunch for the burgers and munchies, so bring a plate =
and fork (often people just bring a disk and a spoon) or whatever you =
like. Note that you can also get by with you hands, but it may get a =
little messy.=20

=20

First pull is at 10am sharp,

=20

Mike

Make sure to book your hotel rooms soon as the PGA is also hosting a =
tournament in town that weekend. The free camping option is always =
available as well - see below.=20

=20

We are planning on a group dinner for those that are interested on =
Saturday night at Magnan's - a classic Montreal joint. We will need to =
get an idea of numbers by the start of the tourney.

=20

Finally, there will be a BBQ, bagels, water, and other assorted food at =
the fields, as well as a physio and other stuff.=20

Captains and Players,

=20

The tournament last year worked out great with a very high and fairly =
even level of play.  We are looking to expand it and the defending =
champions from Maryland are ready to defend their title! We had teams =
from different places in the US and Canada and since last year's =
tournament have had interest from a few new places in North America.=20

=20

The 2nd North American Grand Masters Championship will be held in =
Montreal, Canada on September 29th and 30th, 2007. The Open class =
tournament is open to all guys at least 40 years old by December 31, =
2007 and women at least 35 years old by December 31, 2007. The =
tournament will be played on the very nice grounds of the Douglas =
Hospital next to the St-Laurence River on the Island of Montreal.=20

=20

The tournament fee is $250 Canadian or $240 US. The cheque should be =
made payable to Michael Lee and sent to 1117 Sainte-Catherine Street =
West, Suite 709, Montreal, Quebec, H3B 1H9. Please also send the =
following information: Team name and city; team contact name (plus =
email, telephone number, and full address) and number of players on your =
team. Profits from the tournament will be sent to a registered Canadian =
charity selected by the winning team. Note that the tournament =
participants have contributed over $600 to charities over the last two =
years.

=20

Additional information on hotels, camping, and other aspects will be =
sent out shortly.

=20

Registration is officially open until August 31, 2007 and space is =
limited, with late bids accepted if space is available. Please contact =
mlee@montrealconsulting.com or at 514 840-0938 if you are interested =
prior to sending your cheque and contact info. Early registration is =
much appreciated by the organizers and also by distant teams sizing up =
the competition and tournament. Maryland will be tough to beat!

=20

Looking forward to seeing those discs fly,
