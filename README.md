# MailBoxesApp
Prototype OS X app to implement a fluid multi-portal mail UI concept suitable for Mac or iPad.

MailBoxes is intended to solve the human problem "out of sight, out mind" for a user's email. Once an email goes out of view, it is too easily forgotten about. 

How can we improve visibility of current emails across multiple categories such as work and home, as well as prioritised emails?

The design for MailBoxes was triggered by two thoughts,
1. For users with multiple email accounts such as home and work, how can we easily view both together but separate? Current mail UIs throw all the email into one inbox which means your latest home email may be buried in 2 pages of work email. I wanted to be able to see the latest of both.
2. I am happy with the email subject presentation of an iPhone which takes up much less space than the standard desktop UI. How can I get this content presentation efficiency on a desktop email client? 
3. How can I make it easier to switch content views on a mobile device?

Combining those thoughts led to ... what if we used the vast realestate of the desktop to present multiple side by side iPhone sized views of the users email? What if each content view was email subject content presented in a portal roughly the size of an iPhone but on a desktop?

Using the same concept on a mobile device, the iPhone view could be side to side swipable to quickly switch through the same content as the desktop layout. Tablets could use a layout similar to a desktop.

The repo contains a proof of concept with a working IMAP parser.
